### Random Machine Learning Projects

Note: Projects were completed for personal growth and each has a varying level of clear documentation and algorithmic efficiency.

#### Project descriptions: 
- dino_runner_yolo: YOLO model implementation to detect whether a user's palm is open or closed (based on personal data), and separate driver program that feeds commands to play the Chrome dinosaur game using Selenium.
- trigger_word_detector: Unidirectional multilayered RNN model to detect when a trigger word is said (based on personal data and heavy data synthesis), and separate driver program using multithreading to detect utterances on the fly.
- face_recognition: Implemented a facial recognition model based on FaceNet.
- rnn_with_attention: Implementation of a RNN with an attention mechanism for the task of date normalization.
