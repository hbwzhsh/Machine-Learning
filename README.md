### Random Machine Learning Projects

Projects descriptions: 
- dino_runner_yolo: YOLO model implementation to detect whether a user's palm is open or closed (based on self-labeled data), and separate driver program that feeds commands to play the Chrome dinosaur game using Selenium.
- trigger_word: Unidirectional multilayered rnn model to detect when a trigger word is said (based on self-collected data and heavy data synthesis), and separate driver program with multithreading to detect utterances on the fly.
- face_recognition: Implemented a model based on FaceNet.
- neural_style_transfer: Implemented a model based off the paper - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style. ([Video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathaniel-andre_computervision-deeplearning-activity-6484430196412944384-Zjj3))
- recommender_system: Collaborative filtering implementation.
- language_model: A character level rnn for learning the semantics of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister (using MLE for text production).
- anomaly_detection: Gaussian anomaly-detection w/ multivariate and univariate implementations.
- googLeNet_model: Implemented model based on GoogLeNet.
- resnet_model: Implemented resnet-50 model in Keras and Tensorflow.
- clustering: K-means clustering implementation.
- dense_neural_net: Manually built neural network with hidden layers and sigmoid/relu activation, xavier initialization, and adam optimization implementations.
- linear_regression: Linear regression implementation using gradient descent.
- logistic_regression: Logistic regression implementation using gradient descent.
- naive_bayes: Bayesian classification model based on gaussian likelihood.
- genetic_algorithm:
  1. Simple instance of a genetic algorithm to find parameters that maximize a simple objective function.
  2. Simple genetic algorithm to learn how to play an implementation of the snake game.
