### Personal deep learning projects

Projects descriptions: 
- dino_runner_yolo: Implemented and used a yolo model to detect whether my hand was open or closed and used that information to feed keys to the Chrome dinosaur game using Selenium.
- face_recognition: Implemented a model based on FaceNet.
- googLeNet_model: Implemented a model based on GoogLeNet.
- resnet_model: Implemented a resnet-50 model in Keras and Tensorflow.
- simple_yolo_detection: Implemented a number of helper functions for the YOLO model and train a model based on one prediction per cell.
- neural_style_transfer: Implemented a model based off the paper - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.
- language_model: A character level rnn testing out 5 different architectures in a winner-take-all setting for learning the semantics of dinosaur names
- sentiment_scoring: Testing unidirectional and bidirectional rnns using word embeddings for sentiment classification of 3 diverse datasets of customer reviews
