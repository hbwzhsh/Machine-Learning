### Random Machine Learning Projects

Projects descriptions: 
- dino_runner_yolo: Implemented and used a yolo model to detect whether my hand was open or closed to feed commands to the Chrome dinosaur game using Selenium.
- trigger_word: building a unidirectional multilayered rnn to detect when a trigger word is said, with a focus on data synthesis.
- face_recognition: Implemented a model based on FaceNet.
- neural_style_transfer: Implemented a model based off the paper - A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style. ([Video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathaniel-andre_computervision-deeplearning-activity-6484430196412944384-Zjj3))
