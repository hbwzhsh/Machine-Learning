### Machine Learning Projects

Projects descriptions: 
- dino_runner_yolo: Implemented and used a yolo model to detect whether my hand was open or closed to feed commands to the Chrome dinosaur game using Selenium.
- trigger_word: building a unidirectional multilayered rnn to detect when a trigger word is said, with a focus on data synthesis.
- face_recognition: Implemented a model based on FaceNet.
